This script is suppose to use hdate to calculate the start time of Shabbat and play a Shofar blast 20 min before.  It also will stop mpg123 from playing the radio stream and restart it after.

At this point it is pretty simple and has longitude, latitude and time zone hard coded.  Would prefer this to be set in a config file.

Requires:  libhdate 1.4.20-4, at, sed. mpg123, amixer, espeak

The things I want it to do that fall outside of my skill set.

3 Calculate daily prayer times and display and/or play suitable audio file.

4 Play suitable audio file for the start of services on Shabbat and Yom-Tove. 

5 Include features to interface with home automation to turn lights off and on.
